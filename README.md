# AI Pattern recognition 
- mission carried out within Bandai Namco Studios

## Aim of the mission
- create an interface allowing to draw on it and to save the drawing and its label as new data (a man, a car, a house...)
- Process and save the drawings to optimize the learning phase.
- code an ANN that will predict what is the drawing I made thanks to my previous drawings.

Finally, to add some precision, I added some complexity in the pixelâ€™s reduction and introduced an "average pixel" so that the neural network has some more precise information while learning. Indeed, instead of having black and white pixels, I now have different shades of grey pixels, allowing the ANN to have more precision and more data on each drawing.
